# DLInjector-GUI

DLInjector for Graphical User Interface.

Faster DLL Injector for processes. It targets the process name to identify the target. The process does not need to be open to define the target. DLInjector waits until the process executed. 

## USAGE

I want developed the DLInjector GUI in my spare time. If you want to develop DLInjector too, you can send a pull request. 

### If you want to using DLInjector from command line, look at the [DLInjector-CLI](https://github.com/fatihsnsy/DLInjector-CLI)
